| :---       |:---      | :---        |
| RST        | D0       | This pin resets the module. It an active low pin (resets when 0V is provided)|
| CE (CS/SS) | D8       | This pin is made low (0V) to select this particular display when more than one SPI peripherals are used|
| DC         | D2       | This pin is used to switch between Data mode (high) and Command mode (low) |
| DIN (MOSI) | D7       | This is the input pin (MOSI) through which serial instructions are sent |
| CLK        | D5       | All SPI modules require a common clock, this clock source is supplied to this pin |
| VCC        | 3V3      | This pin is used to power the display the supply voltage is from 2.7V to 3.3V |
| BL         | 3V3 or - | This pin powers the backlight of the display (3.3V maximum) |
| GND        | G        | Connects to the ground of the circuit |
